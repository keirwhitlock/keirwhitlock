## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### 100DaysOfCode [Java] 

I'm attempting the #100DaysOfCode challenge, this time on the topic of Java. Specifically Core Java, as I'd like to use it as a springboard from which to study for and pass the [1Z0-830](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-21-developer-professional/pexam_1Z0-830) Developer Professional Exam.

I'm currently on day 078/100 of the challenge, at time of writing, so not long to go. However there is much to learn before taking the exam.
